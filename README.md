Repository to build [xgboost4j](https://github.com/criteo-forks/xgboost) JARs.

Build
-----

The build would always use the *latest* version of xgboost and its submodules.
Sadly, there is no way around it at the moment, as the submodules are pinned
to specific commits and `dmlc-core` received quite a few patches to be buildable
on both CIs. In the future, this behaviour could be safely removed.

Otherwise, the following versions of the dependencies are used

```
HADOOP_VERSION=2.6.0-cdh5.5.0
SPARK_VERSION=2.1.0
SCALA_VERSION=2.10.6
```

You could probably change them to more recent/different version, but this has
not been validated yet.

Release
-------

To make a release:

- Bump `XGBOOST_VERSION` in `.travis.yml` and `appveyor.yml`.
- Merge `master` into `release`.
- Wait :)

Note that the deployment process is not polished. Specifically, I think it
could break if Travis publishes the artifacts ahead of Appveyor.
